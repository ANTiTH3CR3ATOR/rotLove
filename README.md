RogueLike Toolkit in Love
=========
Bringing rot.js functionality to Love2D

Currently Implemented:

Display          - via [rlLove](https://github.com/paulofmandown/rlLove), only supports cp437 emulation rather than full font support.

rng              - via [RandmLua](http://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=3424), doesn't support state export

String Generator - Direct Port from rot.js

Demos Folder
==========
Added new demos folder.

In Demos/main.lua, uncomment the line for the demo you'd like to see.

Then, from the Demos directory in the shell, run `love .`
